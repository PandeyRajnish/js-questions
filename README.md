  <h1>JavaScript Questions</h1>
</div>

> [!NOTE]  
> This repository was created in December 2024, and the questions provided here are based on the JavaScript syntax and behavior as of now. Since JavaScript is a constantly evolving language, future updates to the language may introduce features that are not covered in the questions here.

###### 1. What's the output?

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  console.log(name);
  console.log(age);
  var name = "Rajnish";
  let age = 25;
}

sayHi();
```

- A: `Rajnish` and `undefined`
- B: `Rajnish` and `ReferenceError`
- C: `ReferenceError` and `21`
- D: `undefined` and `ReferenceError`

<p>

#### Answer: D

Within the function, we first declare the `name` variable with the `var` keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.
